            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Dal Raj Ghale. I am a JavaScript web developer, currently studying at CODE-YOU Kentucky. I am a space enthusiast who is fascinated by the wonders of space. I have always been curious about the ever-expanding universe, the beauty of distant galaxies, potential new discoveries, the stars, and the constellations.
                I have created this website for all those space lovers who want to keep track of space exploration and aim to share all the knowledge with you.

            <h2>What can you find here:</h2>
            <h3>NASA News:</h3>
            <p>
                NASA is an independent agency responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, interplanetary exploration, and space research, which was established in 1958. This page is for those who want to keep updated on NASA, their research, and their findings.
            </p>
            <h3>NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD):</h3>
            <p>
                Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. These often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration. Every day at midnight 00:00 Eastern Time (ET), it refreshes and a new picture is updated.
            </p>
            <h3>Search Date:</h3>
            <p>
                APOD has stored images with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995. You can find all the images with explanations from each date from June 16, 1995.

            <h2>Future:</h2>
            <p>
                NASA has a lot of different open APIs that we can use. I aim to collect and integrate all of NASA's open APIs into a single, comprehensive website. This project will be a centralized platform for accessing all the wealth of space-related data, images, and information.
